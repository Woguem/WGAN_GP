This code implements a Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) to generate MNIST digit images, using a discriminator regularized by a gradient penalty to stabilize learning. It alternates between updating the critic (n_critic times) and the generator, while periodically saving visual samples to track progress. The gradient penalty (lambda_gp) replaces weight clipping to impose a 1-Lipschitz condition, while the RMSprop optimizer and fully connected architecture are typical of WGANs.
